Title: Greed

Description: Greed is a simple game to play. To begin, run the __main__.py file. This will open a window. Your character is the number symbol at the bottom of the window. Press the left and right arrow keys to move. Different color gems and rocks will fall from the top of the screen. If you touch a gem you receive one point. However, if you touch a rock you will lose one point. And that's it! The game keeps going until you click the x to close the window.
